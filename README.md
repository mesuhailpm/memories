Implememntation of my Memories app


Need fixes.
## Like button
First like after a refresh (currently no limit for like) is not reflecting on view

added a async await in handleLike seems it sorted

## Updates
changes to post/memory not reflecting always on the view
DEleting was not updating. solution removed dispath(getPosts()) inside handleDelete function

## Lastly
i have three branhes in my local project
main
part1
part2

main and part1 is having no difference

part 2 is the current one which will be implemented with login auth.
