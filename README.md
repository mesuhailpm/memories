Implememntation of my Memories app


Need fixes.
## Like button
First like after a refresh (currently no limit for like) is not reflecting on view

added a async await in handleLike seems it sorted

## Updates
changes to post/memory not reflecting always on the view
DEleting was not updating. solution removed dispath(getPosts()) inside handleDelete function

## Lastly
i have three branhes in my local project
main
part1
part2

main and part1 is having no difference

part 2 is with login auth.

part 3 is current with pagination and search https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYWgPSbPDfQ

parat 4 is copy of part 3 with layout changes. pagination on the starting phase pagination is layed out without functionalities

want to merge to 4 once pagination is complete

use git push memories par4 to make to push to GH
