Implememntation of my Memories app


Need fixes.
## Like button
First like after a refresh (currently no limit for like) is not reflecting on view

added a async await in handleLike seems it sorted

Update: This was wrong solution: Solved with correction.

## Updates
changes to post/memory not reflecting always on the view
DEleting was not updating. solution removed dispath(getPosts()) inside handleDelete function

This was beacuse of error code. Solved.

## Lastly
i have three branches in my local project
main -- update: deleted
part1 -- updatae: deleted
part2

main and part1 is having no difference -- Not Applicable as deleted

part 2 is with login auth.

part 3 is current with pagination and search https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYWgPSbPDfQ
